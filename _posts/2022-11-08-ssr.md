The next thing I wanted to do was work out how I could template my HTML rather than just returning hardc-oded static strings as we started with. Rocket supports two templating languages [Tera](https://tera.netlify.app/) and [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/). Ideally there'd be a nunjucks parser since that's what the GovUK Design system mostly uses but both the available options seem equally viable and work pretty similarly.

Tera seems to support more complex templating so that's what I decided to start with. First we need to add support for Template responses to Rocket via a crate `rocket_dyn_templates`. This along with a couple of crates for database support make up the rocket "contrib library" and are part of Rocket, just nicely modularized.

```bash
cargo add rocket_dyn_templates --features tera
```

Then we can modify our request handler to return a template:

```rust
#[get("/")]
fn start_page() -> Template {
    Template::render("index", context! {text: "Hello, world!"})
}
```

and then create the actual template `/templates/index.html.tera`

```tera
{{ text }}
```

and our previous test still passes. We can use the context macro to pass in other data structures (Structs, Vecs, what have you) that we can loop over in the template as normal.
